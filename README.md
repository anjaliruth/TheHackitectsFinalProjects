# TheHackitectsFinalProjects

For the final project of the School of Code bootcamp, our team set out to solve the following problem: Since the end of COVID-19, pet abandonment in the UK has surged as people return to work. Shelters are overwhelmed with animals and resulting administration. Our solution provides a marketplace connecting potential adopters to dogs, freeing up the shelters to use their time on animal care.
